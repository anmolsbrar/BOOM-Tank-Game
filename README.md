# BOOM! Tank Game
BOOM! tank game is a 2D scroll video game developed in Java by Frag0man. In this game player is pitched against two enemy tanks. Users can move their tank. However, the enemy tanks are stationary. You have to destroy those enemy tanks. However, there is a catch! Enemy tanks are self destructive, if you get too close to them, you will lose. You have to destroy enemy tanks to get past.

#### Instructions:
This code uses JavaX library. Hence, you would need compiler that can compile and run JavaFx, I used [e(fx)clipse](https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html) for that. Upon running the game, you can simply play the game.

Move Right - Right Arrow Key
Fire - Space

Rules are really basic. You must destroy the enemy tanks and stay alert! Because you cannot run into the enemy tanks else they will explode and you will lose.

* Be familiar with JavaX library for graphics.
* Basic understanding of Java.
* Java classes and frames.
* Java ArrayList and collisions.
